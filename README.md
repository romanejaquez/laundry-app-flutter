# Flutter POS App (Laundry App)

This is a prototype Flutter application for a local business in my community (a dry cleaners local mom-and-pop shop).
The application is developed in Flutter, and uses Firebase to leverage some of its real-time capabilities.

## (THIS APP IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT - CODE IS CONSTANTLY BEING UPDATED)
- The app is meant to be run on a Mini-PC that serves as a Point-Of-Sale (POS) for the small business.
- The app is meant to use a Brother P-Touch Cube printer to print receipts (see [Flutter Brother](https://github.com/CodeMinion/another_brother) for more info on integrating Brother printers with your Flutter apps)
- The app is meant to be responsive, since it will be used both as a QRCode scanner (ran on a mobile device) and as the main POS system (on the Mini-PC). Still working through its responsiveness.

Coming Soon:
- Integrate Payments via Stripe Firebase Extension
- NFC integration to receive payments via NFC-enabled devices
